		<div class="important">
			<strong><em>IMPORTANT</em></strong>: when importing files in lua scripts for the game,<br>
			note that everything is imported from the executable's working<br>
			directory which means that if the file is in res/scripts and is<br>
			called foo.lua, we would need to do the following:<br>
			<br>
			<div class="code">
				local foo = require("res.scripts.foo")
			</div>	
		</div>

		<br>
	
		<div class="box">
			<h3>spawnwave.lua</h3>
			<p>
				Whenever there are no more enemies on the screen and no more enemies<br>
				are going to be added to the screen, the game calls spawnwave() which<br>
				is given two parameters: a user data pointing to the enemy list and the<br>
				current wave number.
			</p>	

			<div class="code">
				function spawnwave(enemies, waveNum)<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp if waveNum + 1 &lt;= #spawnWaveFunctions then<br> 
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp spawnWaveFunctions[waveNum + 1](enemies)<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp else<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp spawnWaveFunctions[#spawnWaveFunctions](enemies)<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp end<br>
				end
			</div>
		
			<p>
				spawnWaveFunctions is a local table in the file that contains the functions<br>
				for spawning in enemies for various waves and one can simply add a function<br>
				to the table to add another wave to the game. The final wave is randomly<br>
				generated but it can be changed to do something else.<br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<br>
		
		<div class="box">
			<h3>start.lua</h3>
			<p>
				startgame is a function that is given a single parameter - the user data
				for the game data and then is called once and is assumed to never be called
				again.<br> 
				Insert code here that you want run at startup.
			</p>	
		</div>

		<br>
	
		<div class="box">
			<h3>prefabs.lua</h3>
			<p>
				This is the file for defining "prefabs" or templates of enemies or bullets
				or other gameobjects that are going to be identical.
				
				prefabs.init() is called and imports all scripts associated with prefabs
				as global modules and then also loads textures associated with those prefabs.
				If you want to import textures and scripts that are not going to immediately
				be used by prefabs, you are going to have to manually import those.
				
				<h4>prefabs.newprefab(name, luapath, mod, imagepath)</h4>
				This function creates a prefab with a name and imports the script at
				'luapath' to define behavior for the object by importing the module of
				name 'mod' as a global module and then associates the image at 'imagepath'
				with the object.
				
				<h4>Example:</h4>
				<div class="code">
					-- Creates a prefab with name "alien" and then<br>
					-- runs res/scripts/enemies/alien.lua and enemies/alien.lua<br>
					-- is assumed to have a module with name "alien" and it then<br>
					-- calls alien = require("alien")<br> 
					-- Any "alien" sprites will be displayed with res/images/alien.png by default<br>
					prefabs.newprefab("alien", "res/scripts/enemies/alien.lua", "alien", "res/images/alien.png")<br>
				</div>	

				<h4>prefabs.loadres()</h4>
				imports all scripts and textures needed by prefabs, assumed to be called only
				once and after all prefabs have been defined in prefabs.init()
				
				<h4>prefabs.addPrefab(gameobjectlist, x, y, sprite)</h4>
				<strong>gameobjectlist</strong> - user data pointing to a gameobject list<br>
				<strong>x, y</strong> - coordiantes to place the new prefab<br>
				<strong>sprite</strong> - string that is the name associated with the prefab<br>
			</p>		
		
			<div class="important">
				<strong><em>IMPORTANT:</em></strong> gameobjectlist must not be nil or the game will crash!
			</div>	

			<h4>Example:</h4>
			<div class="code">	
				local enemies = game_getEnemyList(game)<br>
				-- Adds a single sprite to the gameobject list<br>
				-- enemies of the prefab "alien" at the<br>
				-- coordinates (0, 0)<br>
				prefabs.addPrefab(enemies, 0, 0, "alien")
			</div>	
		</div>

			<h3>structure of [gameobject].lua</h3>
			
			<h4>Template enemy code:</h4>
			
			<div class="code">
				local enemy = {}<br>
				<br>
				-- run this upon enemy start<br>
				function enemy.start(self)<br>
				<br>
				end<br>
				<br>
				function enemy.update(self, game, timepassed)<br>
					 <br>
				end<br>
				<br>
				-- run this when the enemy collides with a bullet<br>
				-- returns a value true or false,<br>
				-- if the value is true, then delete the enemy,<br>
				-- if the value is false, then do not delete the enemy<br>
				function enemy.oncollision(self, game)		<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp -- Delete object if health is less than or equal to 0<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp return true<br>
				end<br>
				<br>
				return enemy<br>
			</div>	

			<br>

			The module is named 'enemy' and the function enemy.start(self)
			is called when the enemy is created and is not called again by the game,
			this is meant to initailize values such as health, score value, and velocity
			of the enemy. The parameter 'self' is a user data pointing to data
			associated with the enemy.<br>

			<br>
			
			enemy.update(self, game, timepassed) is called every frame and is given three arguments:<br>
			 &nbsp&nbsp - self<br>
			 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - User data pointing to sprite data<br>
			 &nbsp&nbsp - game<br>
			 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp - User data pointing to game data<br>
			 &nbsp&nbsp - timepassed<br>
			 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	- Number that is the amount of time the previous frame took,<br>
			 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     use this to update the enemy's internal timer (see <a href="enemy_functions.html">enemy_setObjectTimer</a>)<br>
				  <br>
				  And also for moving the enemy at a fixed speed regardless of frame rate:	<br>
				  <br>
			<div class="code"> 
				  -- Get object's position<br>
				  x, y = enemy_getObjectPos(gameobject)<br>
				  -- Get velocity<br>
				  velx, vely = enemy_getObjectVel(gameobject)<br>
				  -- move the object<br>
				  enemy_setObjectPos(gameobject, x + velx * timepassed, y + vely * timepassed)<br>
			</div>	
			<br>
			enemy.oncollision(self, game) is called when the enemy collides with a bullet the player shot.<br>
			It is given two arguments: self and game - self is the user data pointing to the enemy and
			game is user data pointing to the game data struct.
			<br><br>	

			Example code for how an enemy might behave when shot by a bullet follows:
			<div class="code">	
				function enemy.oncollision(self, game)<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp -- Lower health by one when shot<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp health = enemy_getObjectHealth(self)<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp health = health - 1<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp enemy_setObjectHealth(self, health)<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp -- if out of health, explode<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp if health &lt;= 0 then<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp x, y = enemy_getObjectPos(self)<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp local vis = game_getVisualEffectList(game)<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp prefabs.addPrefab(vis, x, y, "explosion")<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp end<br>
					<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp -- Delete object if health is less than or equal to 0<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp return health &lt;= 0<br>
				end<br>
			</div>

			<br>
			<p>	
				If the function enemy.oncollision returns true, the object is deleted from the game object list.<br>
				If it returns false, the program keeps it in the list.
			</p>
