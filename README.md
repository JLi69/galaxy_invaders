# Galaxy Invaders

This is a simple game that is sort of a Space Invaders / Galaga clone but the
enemies can be scripted using Lua. I am making this just to test my knowledge
of the Lua programming language and if I can integrate it into a C program
(like a simple game).

This project is still a WIP so there will likely be a lot of changes in the
future.
